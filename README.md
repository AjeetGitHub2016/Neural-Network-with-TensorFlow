# Neural-Networks-with-TensorFlow
This is a good tutorial for hands-on tensor flow and tflearn for deep learning applications. This repository contains implementation of simple neural networks, CNNs and RNNs using tensor flow and tflearn libraries.

Tensorflow is the Google's open source library for machine learning(ML) applications. It is getting edge compare to other ML open source libraries. To start with the tensor flow documentations[https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started] may become little bit difficult for the biggners. For them, this is the place to get started in tensorflow and tflearn.

# Repository Structure
datasets: contains the datasets used in the tutorials.                                                                                     
images: contains images which are used in the python notebooks.                                                                           
.ipynb: Python notebooks (name of files and commit comments are talking about the content of the files)[started from 0 to 5]
